# Implementation of the Casas-Alvero procedure

We implement the Casas-Alvero procedure in Maple. The Casas-Alvero procedure is developed by Eduardo Casas-Alvero in the paper _"Polar germs, Jacobian ideal and analytic classification of irreducible plane curve singularities"_ published in 2022. 

Since the Casas-Alvero procedure is indeed a procedure and not an algorithm, we had to make some choices to implement it. This implementation is part of the INIREC scholarship in _"Automatizaci√≥n de estratificaciones de espacios de moduli de ramas planas"_ associated to the UPC Research Group **Geometria de Varietats i Aplicacions** (GEOMVAP).
